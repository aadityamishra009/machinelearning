LAB 1-6 Dataset - Diabetes Dataset Shape: (500, 9) Columns: Various medical measurements related to diabetes diagnosis Missing Values: 225 Description: A modified version of the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset with missing values.

LAB 7 Dataset - Iris Dataset Shape: (150, 5) Columns: Sepal and petal measurements along with species classification Missing Values: 12 Description: A modified version of the famous Iris dataset with missing values, used for classification problems.


Best Model that worked for Me: Decision Tree - Its is useful in both classification and regression tasks unlike linear regressions(only for regression) and K-means(only for clustering).unlike KNN, the data does not need to be standardized or normalized, Decision Trees can capture complex, non-linear relationships between features and target variables. Unlike Naïve Bayes, which assumes complete data, Decision Trees can handle missing values by splitting data intelligently. Decision Trees provide clear and interpretable rules, making them more understandable than K-Means or Naïve Bayes, which work with probabilities and distances. Unlike NLP models, which require large text datasets to perform well, Decision Trees can work efficiently even on small datasets. Accuracy : 81%
